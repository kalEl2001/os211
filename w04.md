# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Arrow operator -> in C/C++ with Examples - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrow-operator-in-c-c-with-examples/)<br>
While studying pointers in the C language, you might encounter a new operator that looks like "->." Find out what it really is and how to use it on this page.

2. [function - Pass by reference in C - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1919718/pass-by-reference-in-c)<br>
When I learn to program in C++, I realized that we can change the parameter value passed to a function by using the pass by reference method, and I wonder why I can't do it in C. This forum thread will tell you why and the alternate route to achieve the same thing.

3. [Tutorial -- The DOs and DON'Ts of Pointers](http://www.tagenigma.com/cgi-bin/tutorial_pointers.pl)<br>
Before you try to code with pointers, you might want to read this. This contains everything you can and cannot do with a pointer.

4. [C/C++ Pointers vs Java References - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/is-there-any-concept-of-pointers-in-java/)<br>
After you learn about C pointers, you might see some similarities between C pointers and Java references. This page will actually tell you the difference between them.

5. [Difference between C structures and C++ structures](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-c-structures-and-cplusplus-structures)<br>
As a former C++ programmer, it feels a bit weird when I see the struct usage of the C programming language. This page told me everything different between C and C++ structs.

6. [Basics of Memory Addresses in C](https://denniskubes.com/2012/08/17/basics-of-memory-addresses-in-c/)<br>
Have you ever wonder how data is stored when you run a program written in C? This page will tell you how the data used in a program written in C is stored.

7. [architecture - What is the advantage of little endian format? - Software Engineering Stack Exchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/95556/what-is-the-advantage-of-little-endian-format)<br>
Ever wonder why data are being stored using little endian format? This forum thread will tell you why!

8. [What is the Difference Between Physical and Virtual Memory - Pediaa.Com](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-physical-and-virtual-memory/)<br>
If you still wonder what's the difference between physical and virtual memory after reading the OSC-10 Chapter 9 slide, this page might give you a better visualization of it.

9. [Difference between Paging and Swapping in OS - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-paging-and-swapping-in-os/)<br>
When I first read about memory paging and swapping, I can't really tell the difference between both of them. This page helped me to understand what memory paging and swapping really is.

10. [A Simple Makefile Tutorial](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/)<br>
By this time, you must have been used the command "make" a few times when doing the demos that use the Makefile in the directory. This page will tell you how to make a Makefile.
