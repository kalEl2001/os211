# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Process Synchronization in Operating System | Studytonight](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)<br>
Why should we care about synchronization? This page will give you the answer to that question.

2. [Race Conditions and How to Prevent Them - A Look at Dekker's Algorithm - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqnpIwN7dz0)<br>
Still, wondering what a race condition really is? This video will give you a great visualization of the race condition and how to prevent it.

3. [Solutions to the Critical Section Problem](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hamilton/courses/330/notes/synchro/node3.html)<br>
Now that you've seen how to prevent a race condition, you probably want to know another way to prevent the race condition. This page will give you an explanation about the ways to solve the critical section problem.

4. [Monitors in Process Synchronization - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monitors-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
In the previous link, you have probably seen the term "monitors," but there's no explanation on how to implement it. This page will tell you how to implement them.

5. [multithreading - What is a mutex? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34524/what-is-a-mutex)<br>
By now, you might have seen the term "mutex." This forum thread will give you a great explanation about what mutex is.

6. [multithreading - Semaphore vs. Monitors - what's the difference? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7335950/semaphore-vs-monitors-whats-the-difference)<br>
Now that you've seen the implementation of semaphore and monitors, you might notice that both rely on two types of function (wait and signal). This forum thread will tell you the difference between them both.

7. [Deadlock Prevention in Operating System - Studytonight](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/deadlock-prevention-in-operating-system)<br>
You should have seen the term "deadlock" by now. This page will tell you what deadlock really is and how to prevent them when possible.

8. [Deadlock Detection And Recovery - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-detection-recovery/)<br>
Now that you've learned that not all deadlock can be prevented, you might wonder how to detect and recover from it when it comes. This page will give you a brief explanation about how to detect and recover from a deadlock.

9. [Difference Between Deadlock and Starvation in OS (with Comparison Chart) - Tech Differences](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os.html)<br>
You might stumble across the term "starvation" while you learn about the prevention of race conditions. This page will tell you what starvation is and its difference from deadlock.

10. [POSIX Semaphores](http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~mdamian/threads/posixsem.html)<br>
Have you ever wonder how to implement a semaphore in your program? Here's a way to implement them in a C program.
