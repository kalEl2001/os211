# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [GnuPG - gpg man page](https://gnupg.org/documentation/manpage.html)<br>
This page will tell you anything about GnuPG. I read this page when I looked for the options meaning while *ATM*-ing on myscript.sh file.

2. [What is a GPG key, and how do I create it? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-GPG-key-and-how-do-I-create-it)<br>
This thread will tell you what a GPG key is and how to make it. This thread also has a brief history of the GPG key.


3. [gnupg — Homebrew Formulae](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnupg)<br>
This is the page of the Homebrew online package browser about GnuPG. This page will tell you about the name of the package when you want to *brew* GnuPG to your Mac.

4. [RSA Algorithm in Cryptography - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/)<br>
If you wonder how RSA Algorithm is used in this class's GPG key, this page might interest you. It will tell you how the algorithm works on encrypting and decrypting data.


5. [Apa Perbedaan Enkripsi pada SHA 1, SHA 2 dan SHA 256? - SSL Indonesia - SSLindonesia.Com](https://sslindonesia.com/apa-perbedaan-enkripsi-pada-sha-1-sha-2-dan-sha-256-ssl-indonesia/)<br>
In OS211 class, we will frequently use SHA 256 as a way to authenticate our work. Have you ever wonder how it differs from SHA 1 and SHA 2?


6. [optimization - Clang vs GCC - which produces faster binaries? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3187414/clang-vs-gcc-which-produces-faster-binaries)<br>
I was a long-time WSL and GCC user when I switched to Mac. I was wondering before why MacOS uses clang rather than GCC.

7. [The Ultimate List for Learning C and C++ Programming | Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/c/the-ultimate-list-of-resources-to-learn-c-and-c-plus-plus)<br>
This page will motivate you to learn the C programming language. It will also guide you in getting started with C programming.

8. [C documentation — DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/c/)<br>
This page will help you if you ever wonder how to use a built-in function. It will serve you the C programming language documentation.

9. [linux - Difference between chmod vs ACL - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/364517/difference-between-chmod-vs-acl)<br>
When you read this week's slide, you might wonder about what's the difference between chmod and ACL. This will help you understand the differences.

10. [Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption: What's the difference?](https://blog.mailfence.com/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption/)<br>
While learning about the RSA algorithm, you will know that RSA is an asymmetric encryption method. You might wonder now about the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
