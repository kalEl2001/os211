5. [Cara Menggunakan Perintah SCP Untuk Memindahkan File](https://www.hostinger.co.id/tutorial/scp-linux)<br>

6. [Ssh-copy-id for copying SSH keys to servers - SSH.com](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/copy-id)<br>
This page will tell you the step-by-step of generating and installing SSH key. It saved me a lot of time to think about my password to my user account when I forgot about it.

This page will help you solve the problem when you found “FATAL: No bootable medium found! System halted” error while trying to install an OS in VirtualBox. I encountered that error while trying to install Debian on VirtualBox because I didn't realize that I have IDE controller activated on the VM.

8. [Debian User Forums · netinst vs. 1CD install](http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=56715)<br>
